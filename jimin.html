   <h3>Facts about Jimin</h3>
   Jimin has a younger brother.<br>
   He views himself as â€œfatâ€ and his self conscious of his looks and cheeks.<br>
   He jokingly hits his fellow members as a way of showing his affection for them<br>
   If music is playing he will start to dance no matter where he is.<br>
   Once he wrote some lyrics and gave them to Suga. Suga said: â€œYou called these lyrics?!â€ (the lyrics sounded like a children song). Suga asked him to redo the lyrics, but in the end he still couldnâ€™t use Jiminâ€™s lyrics.<br>

  Jimin usually solves his problems himself. If he canâ€™t solve it, he will share it with V and ask for his advice.<br>
  Jungkook is always teasing Jimin about his height.<br>
  He has to use eyeliner while practicing the choreography, else he canâ€™t seem to show strong expressions and he will get shy.<br>
  He has small hands.<br>
